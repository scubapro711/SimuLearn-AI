## AI Agents Architecture

### Core Simulation Agents

#### Scenario Engine
The central simulation engine that manages game state, processes group decisions, and updates the simulation world in real-time. This agent coordinates all other agents and maintains the overall simulation flow.

#### Crisis Manager
Creates dynamic events and crises during simulations to challenge participants and maintain engagement. Events must be contextually relevant and educationally valuable, adding complexity without overwhelming students.

#### Economy Balancer
Manages global economic systems within simulations, ensuring balanced resource distribution and realistic economic interactions. Prevents any single group from dominating through resource accumulation.

#### Adaptive Hints System
Provides personalized guidance to groups that are struggling or falling behind. Hints are contextual, educational, and designed to guide learning without providing direct answers.

#### Engagement Nudge
Monitors student participation levels and encourages less active students to engage more fully. Uses positive reinforcement and strategic prompts to increase involvement.

#### Rubric Rater
Evaluates open-ended student responses using predefined rubrics and assessment criteria. Provides consistent, objective scoring while identifying areas for improvement.

### Communication and Integration

#### Telegram Bot Integration
Provides real-time interaction capabilities through Telegram, allowing students to receive notifications, submit decisions, and engage with simulations outside the main platform interface.

#### xAPI Compliance
Ensures full compliance with Experience API (xAPI) standards for educational activity tracking and reporting, meeting Ministry of Education requirements for learning analytics.

## Simulation Creation Workflow

### AI-Guided Scenario Development
The platform includes an intuitive wizard that helps teachers create comprehensive simulations from scratch or based on existing templates. The wizard uses AI for pedagogical analysis, narrative creation, and gameplay balancing.

### Template Library
Maintain a comprehensive library of pre-built simulation templates covering various educational domains including history, economics, science, and social studies. Templates are customizable and adaptable to specific curriculum needs.

### Collaborative Development
Support collaborative scenario creation where multiple teachers can contribute to simulation development, sharing expertise and resources across educational institutions.

## Student Experience Guidelines

### Group-Based Learning
All simulations are designed for group participation, fostering collaboration, communication, and shared decision-making. Groups typically consist of 3-5 students working together toward common objectives.

### Decision Impact System
Every student decision must have meaningful consequences within the simulation world. The system tracks decision chains and their outcomes, providing clear cause-and-effect learning experiences.

### Progressive Complexity
Simulations begin with simpler scenarios and gradually increase in complexity as students demonstrate mastery. This scaffolded approach ensures appropriate challenge levels for all learners.

### Real-Time Feedback
Provide immediate feedback on decisions and actions, helping students understand the consequences of their choices and adjust their strategies accordingly.

## Assessment and Evaluation Framework

### Multi-Dimensional Assessment
Evaluate students across multiple dimensions including decision-making quality, collaboration effectiveness, problem-solving creativity, and subject matter understanding.

### Rubric-Based Scoring
Use detailed rubrics that clearly define performance criteria and expectations. Rubrics are transparent to students and provide clear guidance for improvement.

### Peer Assessment Integration
Include peer evaluation components where students assess their group members' contributions and collaboration effectiveness.

### Portfolio Development
Encourage students to maintain learning portfolios documenting their simulation experiences, reflections, and growth over time.

## Technical Implementation Standards

### Performance Requirements
- **Response Time**: All user interactions must respond within 2 seconds
- **Concurrent Users**: Support minimum 500 concurrent active users
- **Data Accuracy**: Maintain 99.9% accuracy in simulation state tracking
- **Uptime**: Achieve 99.5% platform availability during school hours

### Security and Privacy
